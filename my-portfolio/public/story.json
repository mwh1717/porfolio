In the process of the arrest I was bit by that individual so hard that it broken skin and damaged the tendon in my elbow. Following that incident, I was left wondering what life held for me. Fortunately, I was friends with a few software engineer who gave me my first lesson in coding after hearing the more detailed version of the above. My first lesson was 'alert('hello')' in the console of a Chrome browser. I was hooked."
